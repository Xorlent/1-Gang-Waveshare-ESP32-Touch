Single Gang Waveshare ESP32 Touch 4.3" Mount
![Waveshare 4.3" Mount Model](https://github.com/Xorlent/1-Gang-Waveshare-ESP32-Touch/blob/main/Images/Waveshare43-Model.jpg)
## Purpose
- This mount allows for a [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3) to be installed in a single gang electrical box.

## Bill of Materials
- [Physical switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086L2GPGX)
- PH 2.0 female connector to provide 3.3V to the Waveshare device via the battery connection
- A 3.3V DC power source
- [8mm x 3mm neodymium magnets (x4)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCXH6W5Q)
- 3oz filament (PETG recommended)
- [3.3V relay module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SZ71K4L) to control devices with the physical switch

## Printing
- 0.20mm layer height
- All componets should be printed with tabs facing up
- Supports must be used to print the back box
- Pause the print when the magnet column walls are finished but before the top chamfer (should be layer 70)
  - Once paused, install the magnets in the correct orientation so the bottom bezel will fasten properly and resume the print

## Using the Mount
- The perforated rectangle at the top of the mount facilitates a cutout for programming without removing the device from the mount
- Once assembled, to remove the top bezel, slide a utility knife under the top lip of the bezel and carefully pry to push the case shell outwards
